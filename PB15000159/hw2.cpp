//功能说明：找到图像中所有圆心在图像内的圆，得到中心点和半径
//colorImg：用来搜索圆形目标的彩色图像
//min_radius：需要搜索的圆的最小半径
//max_radius：需要搜索的圆的最大半径
//min_center_dist：找到的圆心之间的最小距离
//min_radius_dist：同心圆半径之间的最小差距
//max_circle_diff：阈值，圆周差分值低于此阈值，不是圆
//x：数组，存储所有的圆的中心点x坐标
//y：数组，存储所有的圆的中心点y坐标
//radius：数组，存储所有的圆的半径值
//circle_cnt：图像中找到的圆的数目
//max_circle：外部传入参数，圆的数目上限。如果图像中圆的数目超过此参数，根据差分值由大到小进行排序
//返回值：MY_OK或者MY_FAIL
